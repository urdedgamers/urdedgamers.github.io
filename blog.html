    <p>Ins and outs of playing old single player games on Windows 11.</p><br>
    <img src="/pics/CoD1Cover.jpg">
    <br><br>
    
      <p>Just a basic look at what you can do to get old single player games to run on Windows 11.<br> So far I have been successful in getting Call of Duty, Call of Duty United Offensive, Call of Duty 2, Medal of Honor Pacific Assault, Medal of Honor Airborne and the first Far Cry to run on Windows 11.<br> Call of Duty <br> These games the pc did read the disks but didn't always run them. Usually if it was hung up I could just pop the disk out and right back in and it would run. If it didn't then I would go to the Windows menu and right click the disk drive the game disk was in and click autorun and it would run, just have to keep messing with it until you get all the disks installed.<br> Then after all the messing around the game wouldn't start, multiplayer yes, single player nope. <br> From what I understand is Windows stopped supporting the disk security on these old games years ago.<br> So the easiest fix is using a fixed .exe that replaces the .exe for the single player game. Just save the original .exe somewhere in case you need it later.<br> I grabbed the .exe from <a href="https://gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_call_of_duty.shtml">GameCopyWorld</a><br> Everything I downloaded from there I scanned and it was all clean, probably wouldn't hurt to scan the files first before unzipping them. Speaking of unzipping the files you'll have to use RAR or something that can unzip them because the Windows zip utility will fail at unzipping the files saying something is wrong with them. There isn't anything wrong with them it's just Windows rejecting them.<br> Once you get the fixed .exe in place make a shortcut on your desktop for it and I did set the new shortcut to run in compatibility mode and as an administrator just in case. After that you should be good to go. Enjoy.<br><br>
      Medal of Honor - Coming soon</p>
